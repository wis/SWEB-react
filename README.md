# Development
- run `yarn start`
- load project's/top directory or manifest.json to install extension for development

# Sourcemaps
## Why sourcemaps normally don't work with extensions (in Chromium and Firefox)
All browsers with good devtools have trouble fetching and loading sourcemap files if their URL's scheme is not `http://`, for example `chrome-extension://`, `moz-extension://`.

relevant bug issues/tickets: [Chromium bug 974543](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=974543), [Firefox bug 1437937](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1437937)

## How sourcemaps were made to work
by using Parcel V2's plugin system to write an [optimizer plugin](packages/parcel-optimizer-relative-to-local-server-sourcemappingurl-rewriter) that rewrites the last line of compiled JS files to point to a URL of file served by a local HTTP server, instead of the before outputed relative filename path that gets resolevd to `chrome-extension://` or `moz-extension://` when devtools try to fetch the sourcemaps and throw an error.

``` .js
// last line of compiled JS files, before:
//# sourceMappingURL=options.09172a38.js.map
// after:
//# sourceMappingURL=http://localhost:8080/options.09172a38.js.map
```

## Credit for the idea of the workaround goes to Luca Greco [@rpl](https://github.com/rpl)
the idea of using HTTP served sourcemaps files as a workaround I got from [this](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/1194#issuecomment-402494524) comment.
as you can see from the date of that comment and my comment before it, I've been struggling for years from the lack of sourcemaps support for extension development. now the Developer Experiece (DX) for extension development got much better.

## why is the dist directory the top level directory of the project and not a sub-directory?
so we can load the extension from the top level directory of the project so that devtools then can fetch and load the source files from sub-directories like [src](src) and sourcemaps will work correctly.

## remaining issues with sourcemaps in Chromium
Chromium seems to be caching sourcemaps and not updating them when the page auto reloads, even when hard-reloading with a Ctrl+Shift+r the sourcemaps are not updated.
so for now I will be using (and recommending using) Firefox for development.
